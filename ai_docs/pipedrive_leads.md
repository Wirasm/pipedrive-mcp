Leads

Leads are potential deals stored in Leads Inbox before they are archived or converted to a deal. Each lead needs to be named (using the title field) and be linked to a person or an organization. In addition to that, a lead can contain most of the fields a deal can (such as value or expected_close_date).

Get all leads

Returns multiple leads. Leads are sorted by the time they were created, from oldest to newest. Pagination can be controlled using limit and start query parameters. If a lead contains custom fields, the fields' values will be included in the response in the same format as with the Deals endpoints. If a custom field's value hasn't been set for the lead, it won't appear in the response. Please note that leads do not have a separate set of custom fields, instead they inherit the custom fields' structure from deals.
