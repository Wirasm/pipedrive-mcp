Follow the instructions to understand the context of the project.

First, get a visual overview of the project structure:

```bash
tree
```

Now, read the following critical files to understand the project:

- README.md - For project overview
- pyproject.toml - For dependencies and configuration
- server.py - For main entry point
- CLAUDE.md - For project guidelines

Then, use the Task tool to examine any additional core files identified during the exploration.

Please analyze the code and respond with:

1. A concise project summary (what it does and how)
2. Key architectural components
3. Main data flows
4. Important patterns to follow
5. Available utilities and tools
6. Entry points and how to run the project

IMPORTANT: Don't just list files - synthesize your understanding of how the system works as a whole.
IMPORTANT: Identify any design patterns or architectural approaches used.
IMPORTANT: Note dependencies between components.
IMPORTANT: Understand the execution flow from entry point through the system.
