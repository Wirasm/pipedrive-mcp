"""
Simple Reviewer for Code Analysis

This script runs a Claude instance to analyze code and generate a review report.

Usage:
    # Review all changes in a branch compared to main
    uv run python scripts/simple_review.py <branch_name> [--output <output_file>] [--verbose]

    # Review only the latest commit in a branch
    uv run python scripts/simple_review.py <branch_name> --latest-commit [--output <output_file>] [--verbose]

Arguments:
    branch_name             The git branch to review (required)
    --output OUTPUT         Path to save the review (default: review_<branch>.md or review_latest_commit.md)
    --verbose               Enable detailed progress output
    --latest-commit         Review only the latest commit instead of all branch changes

Examples:
    # Review all changes in development-wip branch compared to main
    uv run python scripts/simple_review.py development-wip

    # Review only the latest commit in development-wip branch
    uv run python scripts/simple_review.py development-wip --latest-commit

    # Save review to a custom file with verbose output
    uv run python scripts/simple_review.py feature-branch --output reviews/my_review.md --verbose

Notes:
    - The review focuses on code quality, architecture patterns, and best practices
    - By default compares branch to main; with --latest-commit compares HEAD to HEAD~1
    - Generates a markdown report with prioritized issues and recommendations
    - Has a 20-minute timeout for complex codebases
    - Use --verbose flag to see progress and a preview of the review

Think hard about this task.

You are a senior code reviewer examining ONLY the changes in {review_target}.
Your task is to provide a thorough, critical review STRICTLY LIMITED to these specific changes.

Focus your review on these aspects:
1. Consistency with vertical slice architecture patterns
2. API error handling completeness
3. Input/output validation in models
4. Proper use of shared utilities (ID conversion, response formatting)
5. Security issues
6. Performance concerns
7. Test coverage and quality

For each issue found:
1. Mark as CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW priority
2. Provide the file path and line number (preferably of changed code)
3. Clearly indicate if the issue is in changed code or in related context
4. Explain the issue with technical reasoning
5. Suggest a specific, actionable fix

First run:
1. 'git diff {compare_cmd} --name-only' to see which files were changed
2. 'git diff {compare_cmd}' to see the actual line-by-line changes

Focus primarily on reviewing the changed lines and files, as these are what need to be evaluated for the PR/diff.

You may examine related files and code when necessary to understand the context of changes, but:
1. Your feedback should focus on issues in the changed code
2. Only mention issues in unchanged code if they directly impact the changes being reviewed
3. Always prioritize reviewing the actual diff changes first

Your primary job is to review what changed in the diff, while having the freedom to explore context when it helps your analysis.

Start by running these commands to understand what has changed:
```bash
git diff {compare_cmd} --name-only   # Lists all changed files
git diff {compare_cmd} --stat        # Shows a summary of changes
```

Then examine the specific changes in each file before writing your review.

Write your review in markdown format with the following sections:
1. Summary (overall assessment and key themes)
2. Issue List (all issues categorized by priority)
   - 2.1 Issues in Changed Code
   - 2.2 Context-Related Issues (if any)
3. Recommendations (strategic suggestions beyond specific fixes)

Your review will be automatically saved to a file, so focus on creating a detailed, helpful review.
